# LLM---Detect-AI-Generated-Text
<img src="meme.png" width="500" height="500"/>
Build a model to identify which essay was written by middle and high school students, and which was written using a large language model. My work on this competition can help identify telltale LLM artifacts and advance the state of the art in LLM text detection. By using texts of moderate length on a variety of subjects and multiple, unknown generative models, we aim to replicate typical detection scenarios and incentivize learning features that generalize across models.
